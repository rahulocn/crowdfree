Title: CrowdFree (#KeepSafeDistance)
Theme: Open innovation for COVID-19
Description: 
Introduction:
In this difficult time of pandemic, to fight with Covid 19 we need to stop the spread of virus. The efficient way of doing it is to manage the crowd. Government is taking all the required steps to control the situation, but we can still see people rushing to the general stores/medicals to get the daily essential items for life e.g grocery, medicines. Our team wants to propose an idea for real time crowd management at general stores, pharmacies and at other places so that virtual queues can be maintained via digital tokens instead of the physical presence of individuals outside shops. This will make it easier to maintain social distancing which is critically required in the present situation.
Features we want to include:
Manage inevitable crowds with the use of digital tokens.
Users can examine all the nearby opened shops within a specific radius from their location and opt out for digital token.
Through digital tokens, users can check the estimated time for his/her visit to a shop which can have minimal interaction with other people at the shop.
Real time monitoring of virtual queues at local stores.
Estimating size and capacity of the store, a finite number of customers would be provided with the token to enter the shop. 

Future things good to have:
Easy communication with the shopkeepers: Users can virtually convey their list of items to the shopkeeper in advance which will save visiting time of users.
Extending the application to other areas : Crowd Management could be extended to other essential needs of the public such as visiting ATM, bank and vegetable markets to minimise person-to-person contact.
